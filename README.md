# Diachronic-Engine
Diachronic Engine is a web-framework for the diachronic analysis of corpora lexical features. Diachronic Engine computes word frequency, concordances and collocations taking into account the temporal dimension. It is also able to compute temporal word embeddings and time-series that can be exploited for change detection of lexical semantics.

Details about Diachronic Engine are reported in the following paper:
